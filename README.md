# ML-for-Shadow

This repository contains the source code used in the final project required for earning the title: Bachelor of Computer Science at Federal Fluminense University (UFF/RJ).  

This project involves the determination of accumulated shadow data in urban environments using Machine Learning. The project was inspired by [Shadow Accrual Map](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/shadow-accrual-maps) and used its data as training data. 

The source code is divided into two folders: "data-loading" and "models". The first one, contains scripts to transform and format data from different cities. The second one, contains scripts for training and testing all created models.

This folder contains the necessary scripts to train and test the models, given that the database was previously populated by the scripts in "../data-loading".  

To execute the python files it is necessary to create a virtual environment from the file "requirements.txt".

The folder "final-tests" contains the scripts used to run the last set of tests for the dissertation (Test 1, 2 and 3). The .sav files are binaries that contain the scales used to normalize the data and the models trained in each city/day.

The best model developed (referenced in the dissertation as M4) is trained and tested in the script "neural-network/nn_best.py".
